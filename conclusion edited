This is concluding paragragh

In conclusion solar power has a big potential that can provide enough energy and contribute to our life to a large extent.
Solar energy has the potential of becoming a major component of a sustainable energy portfolio with constrained greenhouse gas emissions. 
Solar power is a limitless resource, can be used for on-grid electricity generation (replacing coal, natural gas and nuclear energy) and can be adapted for off-grid electricity application (e.g., for remote residential consumers) or for powering consumer electronics. 
Overall Solar power has the ability to supply great amount of sustainable energy to people living in Washington State. 
The future of solar power deployment depends on how we deal with these constraints, which include scientific and technological problems, marketing and financial limitations, and political and legislative actions including equitable taxation of renewable energy sources.

Probably don’t have to have the items in parenthesis, since this is the conclusion. You don’t have to give examples because they would have already been given in the paper.
 
The highlighted sentence is very similar to the first couple sentences, so it’s probably not needed.
